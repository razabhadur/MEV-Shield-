# MEV Shield

**MEV Shield** is a cutting-edge tool designed to address the growing issue of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. As DeFi continues to grow, the potential for MEV exploitation—where miners or validators reorder, insert, or censor transactions within a block to extract value—has become a significant concern. MEV Shield provides real-time detection, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies to protect users and developers from these sophisticated attacks.

## Features

- **Mempool Monitoring:** Continuously scans the Ethereum mempool for potential MEV activities such as front-running, back-running, and sandwich attacks.
- **Risk Calculator:** Assigns a risk score to transactions based on their vulnerability to MEV attacks, helping users make informed decisions.
- **MEV Mitigation:** Offers automated strategies to minimize the risk of MEV exploitation, including private transaction pools and gas price adjustments.
- **MEV Attack Simulator:** Allows users to simulate MEV attacks on test transactions, aiding in understanding and preventing such strategies.
- **Community Reporting and Analytics:** A platform for users to report suspected MEV attacks, with a dashboard for monitoring attack patterns and trends.

## Why MEV Shield?

In the rapidly evolving world of DeFi, protecting transactions from MEV attacks is crucial. MEV Shield addresses this need by offering a robust solution that detects, mitigates, and educates users about MEV risks. It integrates seamlessly with existing DeFi platforms and wallets, ensuring the security and integrity of your transactions.

## Installation

To install and set up MEV Shield, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   \```bash
   git clone https://github.com/razabhadur/Mev-Shield-
   cd mev-shield
   \```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   \```bash
   python -m venv mev_shield_env
   source mev_shield_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use mev_shield_env\\Scripts\\activate
   \```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   \```bash
   pip install web3 requests pandas
   \```

4. Update the \`main.py\` file with your Ethereum node URL:
   \```python
   node_url = "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
   \```

5. Run the main program:
   \```bash
   python mev_shield.py
   \```

## Usage

1. **Real-Time Monitoring:**
   - The tool will start monitoring the Ethereum mempool for incoming transactions.
   - It will assign a risk score to each transaction and alert if the transaction is at risk of an MEV attack.

2. **MEV Mitigation:**
   - If a high-risk transaction is detected, MEV Shield can automatically apply mitigation strategies to protect the transaction.

3. **MEV Attack Simulation:**
   - Use the simulator to understand how MEV attacks work and test your transactions in a controlled environment.
